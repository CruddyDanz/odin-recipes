  <p>I love burgers</p>

  <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>350g skinless pollock fillet or other white fish</li>
      <li>200g skinless mackerel fillet</li>
      <li>100g raw prawns</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sea salt flakes</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
      <li>2 tbsp capers in brine, drained, rinsed and chopped</li>
      <li>1 tsp chopped dill</li>
      <li>1 tsp English mustard powder</li>
      <li>1 beef tomato</li>
      <li>½ small onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>4 white burger buns, halved</li>
      <li>4 slices of pancetta</li>
      <li>1 Little Gem lettuce, separated into leaves, rinsed and dried</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps:</h4>
  <ol>
      <li> Place the fish fillets and prawns on a plate. Spinkle over the sea salt, cover, then place the fish in the fridge for 1½-2 hours.</li>
      <li> Rinse the fish and prawns thoroughly under running cold water, then drain well on a tea towel and pat dry.</li>
      <li> Finely chop all the fish with a sharp knife and transfer to a bowl. Add the garlic, capers, dill, mustard powder and bicarbonate of soda, if using (it helps to firm up the burgers), and mix together. Shape into 4 large burgers, cover with clingfilm and chill for at least 1 hour before cooking.</li>
      <li> Meanwhile, make the herb mayonnaise. Place the herbs, egg yolk, white wine vinegar and Dijon mustard into a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Gradually add the oil, whisking continously until it emulsifies and thickens. Season to taste.</li>
      <li> Place the tomato and onion slices on a plate and season. Leave for about 10 minutes to draw out some of the moisture.</li>
      <li>When ready to cook, preheat the barbecue. Toast the buns and set aside. Add the fish burgers and cook for 5-7 minutes on each side until cooked through and lightly coloured. Remove to a warm dish and cover with foil to keep hot. Meanwhile, cook the pancetta for about 2 minutes on each side until crispy and browned. Divide the tomato slices between the buns and then add the fish burgers, wilted onion and lettuce. Top with the pancetta and finish with the herb mayonnaise. Serve immediately.</li>
