# odin-recipes
<p>My first project!</p>
<p>This is my first project, which will show what I have learnt so far going through HTML basics.</p>

<p>The project involves creating a website with a some recipes!
I will show the use of lists, images, headings, links to other pages (on the site and off the site) and the use of italic and bold texts.
I will try to keep my code neat and readable, using indents and appropriate spacing.</p>
